I developed this website as a project to submit to the WebWorks Hackathon conducted by The Android Club, VIT Chennai. 
This is a basic site and I will be committing basic changes. This is just a frontend demonstration. 
The site aims to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 4 set by the United Nations, which is to "Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all". You can view more about it here: https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4

This is a basic frontend demonstration of an online education portal which provides content across various subjects for school students. 
Further implementations of this project can be to:
  1. Add content for each subject
  2. Create a sign-up page where students create accounts to access courses, and teachers can create accounts to manage their students' courses as well as to upload courses on their own
  3. Dubbing of video lectures and translation of written notes/presentations into regional languages and dialects
  4. A form to submit feedback

This site was developed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
I employed the Bootstrap framework to create a better User Interface and along with CSS Media Queries, I made sure to make the website responsive.
